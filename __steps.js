/* 
SETUP SERVER:
1. create a folder in your projects folder
2. go to that folder with cmd (that you created for your server)
3. npm init -y (saying yes to all the questions)
4. open a index.js file
5 npm i express 
6. write the boilerplate code inside index.js
7. nodemon index.js [to see it live] (Since we already installed nodemon long time ago)
8. make some data in a new json file(inside Data folder)
9. add git.ignore file and write "/node_modules" 
10. Push it to github
